# Advent of Code 2020 - Nuzlocke edition
I challenged a few of my friends to participate in Advent of Code, and it
didn't take long for one of them to notice the new Private Leaderboard feature.
However, considering that I had the most programming experience of the group by
a substantial margin, it was only fair that I would have some sort of handicap
to contend with. Hence, we agreed that I could only solve a single day's
problems using each programming language of my choice.

## Languages
This table shows my progress at the end of the event. Rows which are marked
*(unfinished)* indicate that I acquired 0 or 1 stars for the day using a
partial solution, while *(not attempted)* signifies that I had not created any
code for the day's problems.
